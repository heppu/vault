# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.9.0 compared to 1.8. Please read it carefully.

## Identity Tokens

The Identity secrets engine has changed the procedure for creating Identity
token roles. When creating a role, the key parameter is required and the key
must exist. Previously, it was possible to create a role and assign it a named
key that did not yet exist despite the documentation stating otherwise.

All calls to [create or update a role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/identity/tokens#create-or-update-a-role)
must be checked to ensure that roles are not being created or updated with
non-existent keys.
